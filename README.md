# Serbian Parliamentary NLP Analysis

This project explores political discourse in Serbia using transcripts from National Assembly sessions. It extracts, structures, and analyzes data to enhance transparency and civic understanding.

## üîç Project Goals
- Analyze who speaks the most and how
- Detect recurring topics and patterns
- Build a foundation for AI tools that inform citizens about parliamentary behavior

## Structure
- `data/`: Sample of structured speech data (not the full set, due to size/privacy)
- `notebooks/`: Interactive Jupyter Notebooks for analysis
- `scripts/`: Parser that converts raw .txt to structured JSON
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies

## Sample Output
- Topic models, word clouds, and speaker statistics
- Sentiment trends (WIP)
- Metadata-enriched political discourse
